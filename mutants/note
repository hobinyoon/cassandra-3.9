- TODO: Letâ€™s do 4K reads and 128kb writes. 128kb seems to be the biggest write size
	to a block device from my experiment. TODO: Do the same on all EBS devices.

- With this, you might not need to set Xms in cassandra/conf/jvm.options
- You may want an IO-provisioned EBS with this option. Since there won't be
	enough memory for file system cache.  We'll see.


Compaction strategy.
- SizeTieredCompactionStrategy (STCS) is the default one.
- LeveledCompactionStrategy (LCS)
- TimeWindowCompactionStrategy has been added. This has proven to be a better
	approach to time series compaction and new tables should use this instead of
	DTCS. See CASSANDRA-9666 for details.
- DateTieredCompactionStrategy has been deprecated - new tables should use
	TimeWindowCompactionStrategy.
