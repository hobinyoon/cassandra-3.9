TODO: sstable_size_in_mb. Looks like it is only in the LCS. Why would you want
to limit the size? Anyway it is the way to go. To be fair with the other
databases.

TODO: Setting limit to total physical memory available in Linux
- http://stackoverflow.com/questions/13484016/setting-limit-to-total-physical-memory-available-in-linux
- With this, you might not need to set Xms in cassandra/conf/jvm.options
- You may want an IO-provisioned EBS with this option. Since there won't be
	enough memory for file system cache.  We'll see.

"A maximum size for SSTables values has been introduced, to prevent out of
memory exceptions when reading corrupt SSTables. This maximum size can be set
via max_value_size_in_mb in cassandra.yaml. The default is 256MB"

Compaction strategy.
- SizeTieredCompactionStrategy (STCS) is the default one.
- LeveledCompactionStrategy (LCS)
- TimeWindowCompactionStrategy has been added. This has proven to be a better
	approach to time series compaction and new tables should use this instead of
	DTCS. See CASSANDRA-9666 for details.
- DateTieredCompactionStrategy has been deprecated - new tables should use
	TimeWindowCompactionStrategy.
