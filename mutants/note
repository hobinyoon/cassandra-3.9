"A maximum size for SSTables "values" has been introduced, to prevent out of
memory exceptions when reading corrupt SSTables. This maximum size can be set
via max_value_size_in_mb in cassandra.yaml. The default is 256MB"

Compaction strategy.
- SizeTieredCompactionStrategy (STCS) is the default one.
- LeveledCompactionStrategy (LCS)
- TimeWindowCompactionStrategy has been added. This has proven to be a better
	approach to time series compaction and new tables should use this instead of
	DTCS. See CASSANDRA-9666 for details.
- DateTieredCompactionStrategy has been deprecated - new tables should use
	TimeWindowCompactionStrategy.
