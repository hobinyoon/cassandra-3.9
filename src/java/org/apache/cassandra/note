TODO: Take a note of what events Mutants is tracking! Should go in the paper.
- Some of them might be common to all DBs; others not.
- Monitoring API
  - Some of them are for understanding of how Tablets are created and merged.
- Tablet Migration API


Print SSTable level in the stat.
- SSTable levels start with 0. There can be multiple 0s.
- MemTable doesn't seem to have a level.

LCS tablet size? 160 MB by default. Confirmed by experiments.
- [https://docs.datastax.com/en/cassandra/2.1/cassandra/operations/ops_configure_compaction_t.html]

Do you want to keep track of Memtable write count? Not needed for now.

Monitor the number of need-to-read-datafile, a more accurate metric than
SSTableReader.incrementReadCount().
- Still you don't know how many real disk IOs are there since many of them are
  absorbed by the Linux page cache.

There are 2 read paths. In queryMemtableAndDiskInternal(), you can
short-circuit with queryMemtableAndSSTablesInTimestampOrder() or take the other
path.

Cassandra doesn't use row cache by default.
- cassandra.yaml says row_cache_size_in_mb: 0.
- Row cache is not enabled from the table description either.

Diff Mutants on Cassandra 2.x
  ~/work/mutants/cassandra-2.2.3/src/java/org/apache/cassandra$ git diff 7274a40605a5c6f5a9400022db4833e2116510fb .

Cassandra log configuration file: conf/logback.xml
- Print thread name, source file name and line number for the console log

ColumnFamily not there anymore :(
- Figuring out top-down.
