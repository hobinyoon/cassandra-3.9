Monitor the number of need-to-read-datafile, a more accurate metric than
SSTableReader.incrementReadCount().
- Still you don't know how many real disk IOs are there since many of them are
  absorbed by the Linux page cache.

There are 2 read paths. In queryMemtableAndDiskInternal(), you can
short-circuit with queryMemtableAndSSTablesInTimestampOrder() or take the other
path.

Cassandra doesn't use row cache by default.
- cassandra.yaml says row_cache_size_in_mb: 0.
- Row cache is not enabled from the table description either.

- Print thread name, source file name and line number for the console log

ColumnFamily not there anymore :(
- Figuring out top-down.
